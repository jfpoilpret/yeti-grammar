This project is an attempt to define a grammar for Yeti functional programming language.
Yeti currently misses an official and complete grammar.

Defining such a grammar would bring the following benefits:

- serve as reference documentation (or basis for such reference)
- used to generate lexer and parser for yeti REPL and compiler, making future changes easier
